# Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1 # i = i+1

# The break Statement
# The break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

# The continue Statement
# the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# The else Statement
# The else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
